Goodbye World,goodbyeworld.png,4,"In its mere two-hour runtime, Goodbye World managed to communicate to me the harsh realities of indie game development while simultaneously inspiring me to pursue my passion for making games. Although the separation between its gameplay and story elements can at times interrupt its masterful story, the game's utilization of the gaming medium to augment its narrative makes that tradeoff worthwhile.",https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/a-story-that-can-only-be-told-through-a-game/,A Story that Can Only Be Told Through a Game," Although its platforming sections can at times interrupt its compelling story, Goodbye World's use of elements from a uniquely integrated gameplay structure to build its narrative up to a stunning climax left an impression on me that will last far past its credits screen.

Human Resource Machine,humanresourcemachine.jpg,3,"Human Resource Machine seamlessly integrates challenging puzzles with programming education. Even as an experienced programmer, I found progressing through its levels fun and at times pretty challenging. ",https://medium.com/@amm28y/integrating-learning-and-gameplay-human-resource-machine-769837341bd0,Powerful Metaphors for Education; Struggles with a Wide Target Audience,"Its core mechanics and levels very closely parallel fundamental programming principles, which makes transferring in-game learning to real-world contexts very doable. Although its format and syntax may not directly match any programming language you can find, its puzzle pieces and logical thinking procedures can easily transfer to programming in practice. \section In its early levels, Human Resource Machine serves as a great introduction to computational thinking, while its later levels can be a suitable challenge for programmers of all levels. However, in this process of targeting this wide playerbase, Human Resource Machine lacks support for newer, inexperienced players that run into roadblocks when reaching big jumps in difficulty while allowing some experienced players to quickly lose interest in the simplicity of its early levels.",
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,smash.jpg,5,"Although some may not consider Smash a ""real"" fighting game when compared with traditional fighters like Tekken, few can argue with its accomplishment as one of the greatest celebrations of the gaming industry, bringing together over 200 different franchises into one title. Alongside this is Smash Ultimate's accomplishment of being one of the most balanced fighting games to date while having the largest roster ever, with 86 characters.",,What's Great; What Could Be Better,"smash1.jpg Ultimate's game feel is amazing. The use of freeze frames the moment powerful attacks land in combination with screen + character shake, masterful sound design, and flashy yet readable VFX makes landing powerful combos and moves extremely rewarding. smash2.png Unlike most traditional fighting games, Smash's percent system forces the pace of the game to slow down for tense moments. When characters interact at high percents they are sent flying far away, extending the period of time where players have play out these near-death scenarios. \break \break Smash is accessible to casual players yet still manages to provide the depth necessary for high-level competition. Optional features such as items or stage hazards alongside free-for-all game modes for up to 8 players allow factors other than player skill to affect the outcome of a game. Meanwhile, free movement options and mechanics such as b-reversing, RARing, and many more facilitate an evolving meta where high-level players continue to discover new tech for their characters even years after their release. \section The spirits system and World of Light adventure mode are weak. Unlike the metroidvania Subspace Emissary in Smash Bros. Brawl, the roguelike Smash Run in Smash for 3DS, or the tabletop Smash Tour in Smash for Wii U, World of Light and its spirits do little towards providing players with an experience that deviates from the game's core gameplay loop. \break \break Spirits' lack of uniqueness and low impact as primarily stat changes gives players little incentive to collect them, which makes the whole spirit collection system feel like a wasted opportunity. \break \break Although accessible, Smash Ultimate, like many of its predecessors, has many UX issues that serve as an obstacle for players striving to reach high-levels of play. smash4.png Core elements of Snake's kit, for example, are really hard to see, which is detrimental to players with poorer vision, especially when playing the switch on its small screen undocked. For Snake's C4, this isn't a problem since keeping track of where the C4 is adds an interesting layer to gameplay for both players; however, forcing a player to squint to see grenades that explode in a couple seconds after being taken out does not engage with any level of strategy and hurts accessibility. It's a different story for Snake's C4 when it is placed on a player though, as tracking the bomb as it switches between players is a near impossible feat. smash5.png Another example is how difficult it is to tell when a character has used their double jump. Knowing whether a player has a double jump available is essential for that player's approach to recovering as well as to their opponent's understanding of what options they have to cover. In Smash Ultimate, very frequently will players get hit at the exact moment they try to double jump, as it is a valuable resource that opponents will try to take away by interrupting. However, the game only visualizes double jumps with a little transparent ring effect under the character, which leads players who mistakenly think they have a double jump to mess up their recovery and pushes players to make predictions on their opponent's double jump timing when their opponent, in actuality, doesn't even have a double jump available. Again, spotting things that are hard to see is not a part of Smash's core gameplay loop nor does it add to it, so these issues are UX flaws that take away from the interesting decisions that the game's design enables. ",
Overcooked 2,overcooked2.png,5,"Overcooked 2 is one of my favorite co-op games of all time. It accomplishes what few other games can, by creating a truly collaborative environment where players need to communicate constantly throughout a play session rather than one where communications die off after players settle into their own roles.",,What's Great; What Could Be Better,"Overcooked is unique in that constant cooperation is not forced upon the players, it's simply the most effective way to play. \break ¥ While it is possible for one player to contribute more than another, it is often impossible for one player to do 100% of the work, especially in levels where players are separated. This makes the game accessible to groups of players with imbalanced skill levels. \break ¥ When players begin to settle into distinct roles within a level, the game will often throw in a curveball that pushes players out of those roles and encourages them to continue collaborating. \break ¥ Overcooked's simple controls and mechanics make optimization possible; hardcore players can reach near perfect runs (which is often what Overcooked 2's 4 star milestones require) where they feel that they performed as efficiently as physically possible which feels extremely rewarding \break ¥ Every level in Overcooked is engaging in a new way. Despite a simple set of core mechanics, each level introduces a new obstacle / interaction or adds an interesting twist to an old one. This ensures that players will need to collaborate to strategize with every subsequent level, as previously successful strategies almost never apply. \break ¥ The throwing mechanic adds so much depth to speed as well as level design. It creates opportunities for high risk high reward interactions where players can quickly throw an item to its destination but risk losing it if dropped, and opens up the possibility of levels where players are separated from each other \section ¥ Falling into familiar roles and just trusting that your teammate will consistently deliver on a certain task can also be a compelling element of a co-op experience. More levels that allow players to separate after creating a plan at the beginning of a level will be rewarding. \break ¥ Uncertain hazards or elements that feel based on luck take away from the simplicity of the game's mechanics and make optimization feel less attainable. Mechanics such as random fires that block your path feel frustrating because they cannot be planned around. ",
Honkai Star Rail,starrail.jpg,3,Hoyoverse games have always been visually stunning and Honkai Star Rail is no exception. Star Rail features a compelling story and a beautiful environment to explore while serving as a great entry point for players less familiar with turn-based RPGs.,,What's Great; What Could Be Better,"¥ Star Rail's combat system is simple and accessible. Players are never overloaded by options, and the skill point charging mechanic simultaneously adds strategy by making basic attacks essential, and adds simplicity, as most RPGs use a completely separate mechanic such as mana for a skill resource. \break ¥ The simulated universe is robust rogue-like game mode that provides gripping end-game content. The different paths allow players to build off of all sorts of team synergies, and the blessings give players fine control over how deep to dive into each synergy as well as freedom to mix and match them. Path resonance abilities also provide clear milestones in path progression, communicating clear growth in players' power fantasy. \break ¥ Also present in genshin, the daily mission system which provides the player a variety of mission options but only requires a set amount to be completed promote player control and creates an interesting mini-game of which missions to tackle and in what order to reach maximum efficiency. \section ¥ The accessibility of Star Rail's combat also creates the problem of a lack of complexity. Most of Star Rail's strategy comes outside of battle in selecting your party; within battle, players have few options available to them and most problems have one or two direct answers. If players simply do not have the perfect counter, they often do not have the freedom to find it through strategy. \break ¥ Consequently, instances where players are unable to change their party setup before a fight are extremely punishing, as there are situations where a player's party setup makes a fight a complete slog or even impossible to win. \break ¥ An example of a system that provides more freedom for player expression with only slight differences is Octopath Traveler's break system. The main difference in OT is that playable characters often have access to multiple enemy weaknesses whereas in Star Rail, characters are only capable of breaking one element each. Just this small change would give players so much more control over the outcome of a battle without introducing too much complexity. ",
A Way Out,awayout.jpg,5,"A Way Out is extremely experimental in its approach to cooperative design and it pays off. The game allows players to experience so many different dynamics of play between themselves and their partner, which each feel extremely unique and fun in their own way. Although A Way Out may not provide as much variety in level design or co-op mechanics as It Takes Two, it makes up for this with compelling co-op dynamics alongside a much more impactful story.",,Co-op Dynamics,"¥ Co-op puzzles: this is one of the most standard co-op dynamics where players achieve a goal through solutions that require a separate action from each player to function \break ¥ Competitive Minigames: random minigames found throughout the world that pit the players against each other. Fun and low stakes, have no effect on the overarching narrative \break ¥ Spotlight Sequences: sequences where the game focuses fully on one player, forcing the other player to watch. This connects players who are normally only focusing on their own actions and gives each player a chance to show off. \break ¥ Full Asymmetry: players branch off to perform completely separate tasks, without any moment-to-moment collaboration. In these situations, it is interesting to verbally hear from your partner about their experiences, and also feels empowering to put trust in your partner to eventually meet back up later in the game. \break ¥ Turn the Tables: one of the most amazing moments in A Way Out is when it stops being a co-op game and turns fully into a competitive one. Spoiler alert, this occurs at the game's climax, when it is revealed that the two playable characters are actually enemies rather than friends. This completely turns player expectations on its head, pushing players accustomed to leveraging the game's combat system against AI-controlled enemies to now use it against an adaptable human opponent. This shift in dynamics makes the narrative's plot twist resonate powerfully with players. ",
Vampire Survivors,vampiresurvivors.png,4,"Vampire Survivors is fascinating in that it features extremely simple gameplay, rely entirely upon its progression to facilitate player engagement. The only controls outside of menu navigation is moving your character with a joystick, which may seem significant at first glance but becomes less relevant as more and more enemies approach you from all sides. Vampire Survivors was immensely successful but by no means is its gameplay innovative; there are many other games in the genre and Vampire Survivors itself was inspired by a similar game called Magic Survival. What separates Vampire Survivors from its competition? Let's take a look.",,Progression and Feedback; Virality,"¥ Vampire Survivors' short-term progression within a single run is stays fresh and communicates a clear power fantasy. Luca Galante, the dev behind the game, did not care about balancing the power levels of different items and this pays off. For a game targeted towards casual players, the process of discovering overpowered item combinations is rewarding and does not force players into monotonous, optimized playstyles; discovering new combinations is often more compelling than sticking to previous ones that have proven to be successful. \break
¥ Vampire Survivor runs are limited to 30 minutes; this is unusual for rogue-like or rogue-lite games including Magic Survival, which usually feature endless runs. This limit may provide a clear milestone and sense of accomplishment that players do not get in other rogue-likes, and may cater to its casual audience with shorter runs. \break
¥ Perhaps the biggest difference between Vampire Survivors and its inspiration is its use of damage numbers as VFX, as explained beautifully by Adam Millard in his YT video, ""Vampire Survivors Only Works Because We're Stupid"" Many players, especially casual ones, enjoy seeing immediate feedback from their actions. Big, rapidly growing damage numbers in Vampire Survivors gives players a constant sense of progression and a true power fantasy in the late game. \section ¥ Vampire Survivors' ""pick up and play"" accessibility and minimal art style gives it the potential to reach a wide audience. Its availability on Steam also sets it apart from its competitors who are primarily mobile-only. \break
¥ Finally, I must mention the element of luck that went into Vampire Survivors' success. By no effort of its developer, the game had a video made on it from a huge YouTuber, which led some twitch streamer and other content creators to start playing until the game spiraled into the public eye. As I mentioned before, there are games on the market that are very similar to Vampire Survivors and arguably much more polished and feature packed, such as 15 Minutes Till Dawn and Brotato that did not receive the same success. While it can be argued that Vampire Survivor's simplicity is what is responsible for its virality, this without a doubt goes to show the power of leveraging influencers for game marketing.",
Gunhead,gunhead.png,2,"Gunhead has a lot of potential but in many ways is poorly executed. It is the transformation of the top down shooter, Cryptark, into and FPS. Although its new 3D look is immersive and combat mechanics feel fun, many of Cryptark's systems did not translate well to 3D. Poor visibility and cramped level design make moment to moment combat feel frustrating, although the overall goals and progression systems from Cryptark retain their appeal.",https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/gunhead-analyzing-design-choices-in-the-transition-from-2d-to-3d/,,"I would have liked to see developer Alientrap innovate more with Gunhead rather than just transition Cryptark into the 3D perspective. Altogether, Gunhead feels more like a novel experience for Cryptark veterans rather than an improved, reimagined version of its inspiration. Analyzing Gunhead revealed many important design considerations exclusive to 3D format that are not necessary to evaluate in 2D experiences. ",
Game Builder Garage,gamebuildergarage.jpg,4,"Game Builder Garage is an amazing tool. Its interactive lessons prepare players to experience much of the trial and error that comes with game development when they dive into the free programming mode. With respect to director Masuda's original vision to create a way for players to experience that trial and error, Game Builder Garage is successful.",https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/does-game-builder-garage-actually-teach-you-how-to-make-games/,,"The game's integration of a scene editor and visual scripting interface onto one screen is innovative and makes the engine much more accessible to beginners than many publicly available game engines today. Its simple but powerful set of tools cleverly enables players to create a wide variety of games with relatively little onboarding. \break \break On the educational side, Game Builder Garage works towards a wide range of learning goals but fails to push players to mastery on any of them. It teaches players many concepts about game design and development, from game genres and playtesting to physics systems and debugging; however, by guiding players too strongly through these learnings and leaving no room for error, the game makes it difficult to players to apply concepts in practice or in novel situations. \break \break Although, with enough time using the free programming mode, players can obtain a deeper understanding of these concepts by coming up with their own game ideas and guiding themselves through problems along the development process using the tools they learned in the interactive lessons.",
Marvel Snap,marvelsnap.jpg,4,"Marvel Snap is a major accomplishment for the mobile card game genre, innovating in its accessible yet complex core gameplay as well as its successful business model devoid of any pay-to-win monetization.",,The Snap Mechanic; Simplicity; Cosmetic-Only Monetization,"Marvel Snap's betting mechanic, ""snap"", gives players direct control over an external factor, their ELO, during a match, something I've never seen done before. It makes conceding a match a strategic decision to minimize your losses, rather than a way to end the game early after giving up. \break \break Snapping adds a lot of depth without adding complexity, leading to mind games between players who must gauge how confident they are in winning based on their opponent's behavior. Where this depth falls short though in comparison to a game like poker is in the option of bluffing. From my experience playing, players almost never snap in order to fake out their opponent into conceding. And I believe this is because their are many more obvious factors pointing towards the victory of a certain player than in poker, which is much simpler and involves more luck. Although there are ways to turn the tables against your opponent at the last moment, especially through the powerful effects of 6-cost cards, these effects are often not consistent or frequent enough to make a bluffs believable. \break \break However, the game does try to make the option of conceding (possibly after your opponent bluffs) appealing by making it feel less punishing. Instead of saying, ""You Lose!"", the game says, ""You Escaped!"" Ben Brode made a great point in his GDC talk on Marvel Snap that we should try to create a net positive joy from our competitive games; if the winner feels the same amount of joy as the amount of frustration the loser experiences, we have in total put out zero joy into the world through our games! \section Marvel Snap's core gameplay is extremely accessible, perfect for a mobile audience. Cards have a cost and a power level and can be placed at 3 different locations, having a higher total power level than your opponent at 2 or more of the locations at the end of the 6th turn results in victory. Decks only consist of 12 cards and card effect descriptions are never more than about 8 words. marvelsnap_gameplay.png Much of the depth in card games comes from synergies between cards and Marvel Snap takes advantage of this, stripping down any unnecessary complexity to focus on synergies. The special traits of the 3 locations in each game are also revealed gradually, once per turn. This limits complexity at the beginning of a round and increases it over time. It also creates interesting risk vs. reward decisions about whether to place cards onto locations whose traits are unknown, or settle for weaker synergies on revealed locations. \section Finally, one of the most impressive elements of Marvel Snap is its complete lack of pay to win monetization. Of course, there are other games that use a similar system such as Hearthstone, where getting copies of cards does not make them stronger, but even in Hearthstone it's difficult to build a top-level deck without spending to get the cards you need. Marvel Snap's smaller 12-card deck and less complex synergies makes obtaining the cards you need easier. F2P cards are also extremely viable, as many players have reached the highest rank with such. The fact that obtaining card duplicates only upgrades them cosmetically rather than funneling back into obtaining new cards, like in Hearthstone, further shows how unnecessary it is to expand past the options given to you. marvelsnap_upgrade.png",
Warcraft Rumble,warcraftrumble.jpg,4,"Blizzard's Warcraft Rumble builds upon the addicting gameplay of Clash Royale but also switches up the genre in many ways. With a full single-player campaign and larger, scrollable maps with smaller summoning areas, Warcraft Rumble provides a more accessible experience than Clash Royale's positioning-focused competitive gameplay.",,The Maps; Low-Cost Units; Upgrading,"Maps in Warcraft Rumble come in many forms, many including interweaving paths between the two players that contain different objectives. Paths can further be separated by high ground vs. low ground, enabling ranged units on high ground to attack the ones below. \break \break The larger and more varied maps come alongside a much smaller summoning area; players can only summon units in a small area around their base or captured objectives, in contrast to Clash Royale players' combined summoning area encompasses the entire map. This limits the impact of many position-focused decisions in Clash Royale, such as positioning units to draw aggro, or placing units farther back to build a large push. Warcraft Rumble instead forces players to adapt to each map they play and shifts their focus to bigger decisions such as which objective to target, how to path their units, or whether to collect a mining point. warcraftrumble_gameplay.png \section Warcraft Rumble has the same amount of max mana as Clash Royale, 10, but units are generally lower cost. This supplements maps designed to have more objectives scattered throughout them alongside smaller summoning areas. Playing a 8 cost unit in these contexts would be too punishing and would allow the opponent to immediately take an objective before you can recover. \break \break As a whole, lower cost units lead to faster-paced gameplay, keeping the player pressing buttons basically all the time; however, it also makes the payoff for summoning units smaller, as creating one huge push that completely turns the tables into your favor is much more difficult. \section Upgrading cards in Warcraft Rumble has more depth than most games in the genre. After leveling up a card, players need to acquire a combination of 3 currencies to upgrade a card's rarity. Greater rarities allow players to equip more talents or special traits to a card, which must be purchased separately. The ease of leveling cards, with the many options for players to gain XP as well as the lack of coin cost to push a card to the next level after obtaining the necessary amount of XP, gives players a constant sense of progression. \break \break The rarity upgrades and talents however will definitely serve as an obstacle to some players and I hypothesize is where the driving force behind the game's monetization. However, purchasing these talents comes with new card visuals, animations, and abilities, which I find much more rewarding than the primarily flat stat increases upgrades give in games like Clash Royale. warcraftrumble_talent.jpg",
Dynasty Warriors 8: Xtreme Legends,DW8_splash.jpg,3,"The fun in Dynasty Warriors games, particularly 8 which has the most content of any entry in the series, comes from the discovery of new weapons, combos, and characters, as well as the satisfying power fantasy of slashing through thousands of enemies. Dynasty Warriors 8 has over 70 different weapons all with different combos in addition to special combos for characters' signature weapons, and experimenting with all of them is an absolute blast. This series has some of the most creative weapon designs, one of my favorites being a literal boat that characters will swing around and ram into enemies.  ",,What Makes Dynasty Warriors Fun?; The Combat System; Accessibility and Co-op,"DW8_weapons.jpg
\section 
As I mentioned before, Dynasty Warriors' combat system lacks depth; there are tons of combo routes, but different moves rarely serve a unique purpose (at most single target vs. AOE, but even this is not common). Most characters have an optimal combo that does the most damage in the shortest amount of time. There are few high-impact decisions to make in Dynasty Warriors, even character and weapon choices have little impact on the outcome of a battle. While more involved mechanics such as switch counters do exist, use of these is absolutely not essential to victory at most difficulties. \break
\break
Players' primary motivation in these games is not to win a battle or defeat a boss, but to feel insanely cool while doing it. Hitting hundreds of enemies with a single move is extremely satisfying and Koei Tecmo leans into this, pushing players to focus on defeating as many enemies as fast as possible, rather than on winning. Players make choices, from character and weapon selection to what combo route to follow next, based on what will make them feel cool. This is a big departure from more hardcore action games like the Dark Souls series where players will constantly be punished for choosing the wrong actions and may turn away fans who are looking for a challenge. But the success of Musou games goes to show that there is absolutely an audience for this casual form of combat. \section Another benefit of Dynasty Warriors' accessibility is harnessed through its co-op support. This series is one of the few action games that I can pick up and play alongside my non-gamer friends and family. Although co-op gameplay here requires little real collaboration past strategizing who should attack which objective, there is one co-op mechanic that I have always loved in the series, the dual musou. Musou is basically a character's ultimate move. When in co-op, if players are near each other and use their musou at roughly the same time, they will perform a linked, more powerful, dual musou. This feels unbelievably cool to pull off accidentally, and pushes players to communicate with each other to activate it intentionally, which is much needed due to the lack of collaboration in other areas.

AFK Journey,AFK_splash.jpg,4,"AFK Journey is a polished realization of a casual adventure RPG experience for mobile. Backed by the learnings from their previous title in the franchise, AFK Arena, Lilith games has created an addicting and accessible experience inspired by games in the auto-chess genre and genshin impact.",,Game Modes; The Signature AFK Mechanic; Retention Mechanics; IAP Offers,"AFK Journey has an extremely well-rounded distribution of game modes, each of which delivers a unique gameplay experience that targets a different subset of users and serves as an appointment mechanic to bring users back to the game as frequently as possible. AFK_battlemodes.png AFK Journey has a traditional PVP game mode dominated by high spenders, as well as a drafting-based PVP mode for non-spenders to still have a fair PVP experience. Game modes like the Arcane Labyrinth or the Legend Trials provide different content and rewards on specific days of the week, while the game's signature mechanic, the AFK battles, encourages users to open the game even more frequently throughout the day to collect their AFK rewards before they cap out. And that's not all, there's still the Dream Realm, Battle Drills, Primal Lord, and of course the main story mode that serve other functions such as reinforcing daily retention and promoting social features. With this well-rounded distribution of gameplay experiences, AFK Journey ensures that each day of gameplay is unique and that there is something to enjoy for any kind of player that comes across it. This drives strong retention session length metrics, pushing players to return every day and play long enough to claim all of their daily rewards. \section Arguably the most compelling element of AFK Journey is, of course, the signature AFK battle mechanic. Players earn resources while they are AFK to level up their characters, which they use to tackle harder and harder battles. The harder the AFK battle the player has completed, the faster they generate resources to level up their characters. This creates an addicting positive feedback loop where players are constantly collecting resources and attempting AFK battles to maximize their passive income. AFK_afkbattle.png \section Chances are, any retention mechanic you can think of, AFK Journey has it. From multiple daily and monthly login rewards, battle passes, quests, achievements, new user progression tracks, and more, AFK Journey utilizes so many strategies to keep you coming back that its mind boggling how its UX designers managed to make it all not feel overwhelming. \break \break
Like its game modes, AFK Journey's retention mechanics create a clever balance of short and long-term goals. Daily quests, guild quests, and growth trials encourage users to make progress daily, weekly, and at their own pace. Daily login rewards have weekly milestones alongside a curated roadmap up rewards up to 154 days. Battle passes and events or IAP that also revolve around quest completion drive retention even further. \break \break
The question here is definitely what is too much? There are so many progression tracks that I only find myself actively working towards a few of them; the others I will just claim rewards from as I unintentionally but inevitably complete them. Are the extra layers really necessary if I'm already coming back to the game every day? Are they giving out too many rewards? In my ~2 weeks of playing I have yet to run into barrier that strongly pushes me to make a purchase, and the wealth of rewards I get through these progressions plays a big part. Only time will tell if this approach to build up the game's community by not ramping out new users is successful for Lilith Games. AFK_dailylogin.png \section IAP offers are another area where AFK Journey uses basically every trick in the book. The game is great to reference for what IAP strategies are successful in the current mobile game market, so here's a list of some of the most interesting strategies it uses: \break
- First-Time Purchase Offer (rewards given upon a player's first ever purchase) \break
- Welcome Bundles (bundles only temporarily available to new players) \break
- Battle Pass (with F2P, premium, and super premium tracks) \break
- Tiered Offers (offers separated into tiers that must be purchased in order) \break
- Contextual Offers (Shows only when the player is on a relevant screen or is experiencing a resource deficit) \break
- Quest-based Bundles (Unlocks a quest progression towards rewards) \break
- VIP System (frequent buyers get even more rewards and prestige) \break
- Rotating Shop (offers different items every 2 weeks) AFK_IAP.png",
Palworld,palworld.png,4,"Palworld doesn't have fancy graphics, a smooth user experience, or a balanced progression, and is even riddled with bugs. Yet, the game is still undeniably fun. Palworld utilizes its satirical take on the creature collection as a clever marketing strategy, and combines elements from many beloved genres into an experience that feels fresh. ",,"Good Artists Borrow, Great Artists Steal; A Sense of Wonder","With Pokemon Legends-style creature collecting, Breath of the Wild-style exploration, ARK: Survival style combat and base building, at a first glance, Palworld doesn't do anything particularly unique. But it's the combination of these elements that brings something new to the table and targets a niche that players have been asking for for years: an open world Pokemon game where players live and work alongside their creatures. \break \break Although Pocketpair makes fun of this concept by framing the pals more as slaves than companions, the integration of pals into nearly system in the game from speeding up exploration through mounts, helping players gather and build different kinds of resources, requiring food and care alongside the player, and of course fighting alongside you in combat, makes players feel a strong connection to their pals and makes individual pals extremely unique, something that is not leveraged nearly as much in games like Pokemon Legends: Arceus. \section Perhaps what resonated with me the most in Palworld was a constant feeling of discovery and wonder. While the designs of Pals weren't particularly astounding (many referencing designs from Pokemon), Pals mechanically have so many unique traits due to their interactions with the many systems I mentioned above. Pals' active skills felt especially novel, as they ranged from powerful moves to special mounts to even augmenting the player by transforming into their weapon. The diversity of these skills made catching each Pal feel like opening a treasure chest. ",
Alba,alba.png,5,"Alba is a short, heartwarming experience filled with discovery that is well designed to not overstay its welcome. Its open world is small, yet feels so alive; each area has its own visual identity and unique inhabitants. These factors together allow players to become familiar with each part of the island and build strong connection to it, eventually being able to navigate it without a map. This makes the experience immersive and makes the island feel like home, which fits perfectly with the game's narrative theming and relaxing gameplay. ",,,"The photography mechanic synergizes well with this compact style of level design, encouraging players to closely take note of their surroundings, explore at a leisurely pace as to not scare away animals, and return to areas at different times in search of new animals. Alba cleverly utilizes a small set of mechanics that all supplement each other and is balanced to come to a close when these mechanics may begin to feel repetitive, which allows the game's message on environmental activism to leave an impact. This passion for the environment and the developers' connection to spanish culture really resonated with me and their targeting towards player emotions such as compassion and serenity were well delivered. ",
Elsie,elsie.jpg,3,"Elsie may be a bit rough around the edges, but its core gameplay is undeniably addicting. Its UX, tutorials, and narrative delivery leave a lot of room for confusion, and its power curves and room generation aren't carefully balanced. There are times when players will run into the same room multiple times in quick succession, encounter an extremely difficult room right at the beginning of their run, or reach a room that requires them to use a mechanic that they haven't been taught yet. Players can gain find ""upgrades"" that have no effect on their current loadout or even make their loadout worse. Bosses often die in a matter of seconds before players even experience many of their unique attacks, because their health has been set too low relative to the power level that players consistently reach before they encounter the bosses.",,,"elsiesc.png However, despite these shortcomings, controlling the main character, Elsie, is extremely fun. With instant acceleration, full airborne control, and a dash on a short cooldown, movement and shooting feels responsive. Dashing is unique as it also deals damage to enemies you run through, but unfortunately isn't viable to use offensively as it comes with greater risk (getting close to enemies) with comparable or even less damage than firing your blaster. The parry mechanic is much more viable and has a forgiving timing window, which supports the fast-paced power fantasy that Elsie strives to convey well. \break \break All in all, Elsie goes to show that the most essential part of an action game is how the moment-to-moment gameplay feels. While progression, difficulty balance, UX, and other elements are important, none of these can make a game with clunky attacks and sluggish movement fun to play. ",
