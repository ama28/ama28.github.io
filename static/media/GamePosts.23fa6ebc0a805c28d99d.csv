Goodbye World,goodbyeworld.png,4,"In its mere two-hour runtime, Goodbye World managed to communicate to me the harsh realities of indie game development while simultaneously inspiring me to pursue my passion for making games. Although the separation between its gameplay and story elements can at times interrupt its masterful story, the game's utilization of the gaming medium to augment its narrative makes that tradeoff worthwhile.",https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/a-story-that-can-only-be-told-through-a-game/,A Story that Can Only Be Told Through a Game," Although its platforming sections can at times interrupt its compelling story, Goodbye World's use of elements from a uniquely integrated gameplay structure to build its narrative up to a stunning climax left an impression on me that will last far past its credits screen.

Human Resource Machine,humanresourcemachine.jpg,3,"Human Resource Machine seamlessly integrates challenging puzzles with programming education. Even as an experienced programmer, I found progressing through its levels fun and at times pretty challenging. ",https://medium.com/@amm28y/integrating-learning-and-gameplay-human-resource-machine-769837341bd0,"Powerful Metaphors for Education, Struggles with a Wide Target Audience","Its core mechanics and levels very closely parallel fundamental programming principles, which makes transferring in-game learning to real-world contexts very doable. Although its format and syntax may not directly match any programming language you can find, its puzzle pieces and logical thinking procedures can easily transfer to programming in practice. \section In its early levels, Human Resource Machine serves as a great introduction to computational thinking, while its later levels can be a suitable challenge for programmers of all levels. However, in this process of targeting this wide playerbase, Human Resource Machine lacks support for newer, inexperienced players that run into roadblocks when reaching big jumps in difficulty while allowing some experienced players to quickly lose interest in the simplicity of its early levels.",
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,smash.jpg,4,"Although some may not consider Smash a ""real"" fighting game when compared with traditional fighters like Tekken, few can argue with its accomplishment as one of the greatest celebrations of the gaming industry, bringing together over 200 different franchises into one title. Alongside this is Smash Ultimate's accomplishment of being one of the most balanced fighting games to date while having the largest roster ever, with 86 characters.",,"What's Great, What Could Be Better","smash1.jpg Ultimate's game feel is amazing. The use of freeze frames the moment powerful attacks land in combination with screen + character shake, masterful sound design, and flashy yet readable VFX makes landing powerful combos and moves extremely rewarding. smash2.png Unlike most traditional fighting games, Smash's percent system forces the pace of the game to slow down for tense moments. When characters interact at high percents they are sent flying far away, extending the period of time where players have play out these near-death scenarios. \break \break Smash is accessible to casual players yet still manages to provide the depth necessary for high-level competition. Optional features such as items or stage hazards alongside free-for-all game modes for up to 8 players allow factors other than player skill to affect the outcome of a game. Meanwhile, free movement options and mechanics such as b-reversing, RARing, and many more facilitate an evolving meta where high-level players continue to discover new tech for their characters even years after their release. \section smash2.png The spirits system and World of Light adventure mode are weak. Unlike the metroidvania Subspace Emissary in Smash Bros. Brawl, the roguelike Smash Run in Smash for 3DS, or the tabletop Smash Tour in Smash for Wii U, World of Light and its spirits do little towards providing players with an experience that deviates from the game's core gameplay loop. \break \break Spirits' lack of uniqueness and low impact as primarily stat changes gives players little incentive to collect them, which makes the whole spirit collection system feel like a wasted opportunity. \break \break Although accessible, Smash Ultimate, like many of its predecessors, has many UX issues that serve as an obstacle for players striving to reach high-levels of play. smash4.png Core elements of Snake's kit, for example, are really hard to see, which is detrimental to players with poorer vision, especially when playing the switch on its small screen undocked. For Snake's C4, this isn't a problem since keeping track of where the C4 is adds an interesting layer to gameplay for both players; however, forcing a player to squint to see grenades that explode in a couple seconds after being taken out does not engage with any level of strategy and hurts accessibility. It's a different story for Snake's C4 when it is placed on a player though, as tracking the bomb as it switches between players is a near impossible feat. smash5.png Another example is how difficult it is to tell when a character has used their double jump. Knowing whether a player has a double jump available is essential for that player's approach to recovering as well as to their opponent's understanding of what options they have to cover. In Smash Ultimate, very frequently will players get hit at the exact moment they try to double jump, as it is a valuable resource that opponents will try to take away by interrupting. However, the game only visualizes double jumps with a little transparent ring effect under the character, which leads players who mistakenly think they have a double jump to mess up their recovery and pushes players to make predictions on their opponent's double jump timing when their opponent, in actuality, doesn't even have a double jump available. Again, spotting things that are hard to see is not a part of Smash's core gameplay loop nor does it add to it, so these issues are UX flaws that take away from the interesting decisions that the game's design enables.

Overcooked 2,overcooked2.png,5,"Overcooked 2 is one of my favorite co-op games of all time. It accomplishes what few other games can, by creating a truly collaborative environment where players need to communicate constantly throughout a play session rather than one where communications die off after players settle into their own roles.",,"What's Great, What Could Be Better","Overcooked is unique in that constant cooperation is not forced upon the players, it's simply the most effective way to play. \break ¥ While it is possible for one player to contribute more than another, it is often impossible for one player to do 100% of the work, especially in levels where players are separated. This makes the game accessible to groups of players with imbalanced skill levels. \break ¥ When players begin to settle into distinct roles within a level, the game will often throw in a curveball that pushes players out of those roles and encourages them to continue collaborating. \break ¥ Overcooked's simple controls and mechanics make optimization possible; hardcore players can reach near perfect runs (which is often what Overcooked 2's 4 star milestones require) where they feel that they performed as efficiently as physically possible which feels extremely rewarding \break ¥ Every level in Overcooked is engaging in a new way. Despite a simple set of core mechanics, each level introduces a new obstacle / interaction or adds an interesting twist to an old one. This ensures that players will need to collaborate to strategize with every subsequent level, as previously successful strategies almost never apply. \break ¥ The throwing mechanic adds so much depth to speed as well as level design. It creates opportunities for high risk high reward interactions where players can quickly throw an item to its destination but risk losing it if dropped, and opens up the possibility of levels where players are separated from each other \section ¥ Falling into familiar roles and just trusting that your teammate will consistently deliver on a certain task can also be a compelling element of a co-op experience. More levels that allow players to separate after creating a plan at the beginning of a level will be rewarding. \break ¥ Uncertain hazards or elements that feel based on luck take away from the simplicity of the game's mechanics and make optimization feel less attainable. Mechanics such as random fires that block your path feel frustrating because they cannot be planned around. ",
Honkai Star Rail,starrail.jpg,4,Hoyoverse games have always been visually stunning and Honkai Star Rail is no exception. Star Rail features a compelling story and a beautiful environment to explore while serving as a great entry point for players less familiar with turn-based RPGs.,,"What's Great, What Could Be Better","¥ Star Rail's combat system is simple and accessible. Players are never overloaded by options, and the skill point charging mechanic simultaneously adds strategy by making basic attacks essential, and adds simplicity, as most RPGs use a completely separate mechanic such as mana for a skill resource. \break ¥ The simulated universe is robust rogue-like game mode that provides gripping end-game content. The different paths allow players to build off of all sorts of team synergies, and the blessings give players fine control over how deep to dive into each synergy as well as freedom to mix and match them. Path resonance abilities also provide clear milestones in path progression, communicating clear growth in players' power fantasy. \break ¥ Also present in genshin, the daily mission system which provides the player a variety of mission options but only requires a set amount to be completed promote player control and creates an interesting mini-game of which missions to tackle and in what order to reach maximum efficiency. \section ¥ The accessibility of Star Rail's combat also creates the problem of a lack of complexity. Most of Star Rail's strategy comes outside of battle in selecting your party; within battle, players have few options available to them and most problems have one or two direct answers. If players simply do not have the perfect counter, they often do not have the freedom to find it through strategy. \break ¥ Consequently, instances where players are unable to change their party setup before a fight are extremely punishing, as there are situations where a player's party setup makes a fight a complete slog or even impossible to win. \break ¥ An example of a system that provides more freedom for player expression with only slight differences is Octopath Traveler's break system. The main difference in OT is that playable characters often have access to multiple enemy weaknesses whereas in Star Rail, characters are only capable of breaking one element each. Just this small change would give players so much more control over the outcome of a battle without introducing too much complexity. ",
