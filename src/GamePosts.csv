Goodbye World,goodbyeworld.png,4,"In its mere two-hour runtime, Goodbye World managed to communicate to me the harsh realities of indie game development while simultaneously inspiring me to pursue my passion for making games. Although the separation between its gameplay and story elements can at times interrupt its masterful story, the game's utilization of the gaming medium to augment its narrative makes that tradeoff worthwhile.",https://www.superjumpmagazine.com/a-story-that-can-only-be-told-through-a-game/,A Story that Can Only Be Told Through a Game," Although its platforming sections can at times interrupt its compelling story, Goodbye World's use of elements from a uniquely integrated gameplay structure to build its narrative up to a stunning climax left an impression on me that will last far past its credits screen.

Human Resource Machine,humanresourcemachine.jpg,3,"Human Resource Machine seamlessly integrates challenging puzzles with programming education. Even as an experienced programmer, I found progressing through its levels fun and at times pretty challenging. ",https://medium.com/@amm28y/integrating-learning-and-gameplay-human-resource-machine-769837341bd0,"Powerful Metaphors for Education, Struggles with a Wide Target Audience","Its core mechanics and levels very closely parallel fundamental programming principles, which makes transferring in-game learning to real-world contexts very doable. Although its format and syntax may not directly match any programming language you can find, its puzzle pieces and logical thinking procedures can easily transfer to programming in practice. \section In its early levels, Human Resource Machine serves as a great introduction to computational thinking, while its later levels can be a suitable challenge for programmers of all levels. However, in this process of targeting this wide playerbase, Human Resource Machine lacks support for newer, inexperienced players that run into roadblocks when reaching big jumps in difficulty while allowing some experienced players to quickly lose interest in the simplicity of its early levels.",
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate,smash.jpg,4,"Although some may not consider Smash a ""real"" fighting game when compared with traditional fighters like Tekken, few can argue with its accomplishment as one of the greatest celebrations of the gaming industry, bringing together over 200 different franchises into one title. Alongside this is Smash Ultimate's accomplishment of being one of the most balanced fighting games to date while having the largest roster ever, with 86 characters.",,"What's Great, What Could Be Better","smash1.jpg Ultimate's game feel is amazing. The use of freeze frames the moment powerful attacks land in combination with screen + character shake, masterful sound design, and flashy yet readable VFX makes landing powerful combos and moves extremely rewarding. smash2.png Unlike most traditional fighting games, Smash's percent system forces the pace of the game to slow down for tense moments. When characters interact at high percents they are sent flying far away, extending the period of time where players have play out these near-death scenarios. \break \break Smash is accessible to casual players yet still manages to provide the depth necessary for high-level competition. Optional features such as items or stage hazards alongside free-for-all game modes for up to 8 players allow factors other than player skill to affect the outcome of a game. Meanwhile, free movement options and mechanics such as b-reversing, RARing, and many more facilitate an evolving meta where high-level players continue to discover new tech for their characters even years after their release. \section smash2.png The spirits system and World of Light adventure mode are weak. Unlike the metroidvania Subspace Emissary in Smash Bros. Brawl, the roguelike Smash Run in Smash for 3DS, or the tabletop Smash Tour in Smash for Wii U, World of Light and its spirits do little towards providing players with an experience that deviates from the game's core gameplay loop. \break \break Spirits' lack of uniqueness and low impact as primarily stat changes gives players little incentive to collect them, which makes the whole spirit collection system feel like a wasted opportunity. \break \break Although accessible, Smash Ultimate, like many of its predecessors, has many UX issues that serve as an obstacle for players striving to reach high-levels of play. smash4.png Core elements of Snake's kit, for example, are really hard to see, which is detrimental to players with poorer vision, especially when playing the switch on its small screen undocked. For Snake's C4, this isn't a problem since keeping track of where the C4 is adds an interesting layer to gameplay for both players; however, forcing a player to squint to see grenades that explode in a couple seconds after being taken out does not engage with any level of strategy and hurts accessibility. It's a different story for Snake's C4 when it is placed on a player though, as tracking the bomb as it switches between players is a near impossible feat. smash5.png Another example is how difficult it is to tell when a character has used their double jump. Knowing whether a player has a double jump available is essential for that player's approach to recovering as well as to their opponent's understanding of what options they have to cover. In Smash Ultimate, very frequently will players get hit at the exact moment they try to double jump, as it is a valuable resource that opponents will try to take away by interrupting. However, the game only visualizes double jumps with a little transparent ring effect under the character, which leads players who mistakenly think they have a double jump to mess up their recovery and pushes players to make predictions on their opponent's double jump timing when their opponent, in actuality, doesn't even have a double jump available. Again, spotting things that are hard to see is not a part of Smash's core gameplay loop nor does it add to it, so these issues are UX flaws that take away from the interesting decisions that the game's design enables.
