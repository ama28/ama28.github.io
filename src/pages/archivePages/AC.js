                    <p>For this project, I redesigned an AC unitâ€™s interface to <b>make it more accessible for the visually impaired</b>, with the intention that doing this would make it more accessible for all.</p>

                    <p>After identifying flaws in the original design (shown on the right), such as misleading affordances or lack of feedforward, <b>I went through a design process that consisted of brainstorming sessions followed by multiple iterations through critique.</b> Below are some sketches of the process.</p>

                    <p>I <b>utilized foam core to prototype and test</b> many of my ideas until reaching a final design.</p>
                    <p>By integrating the fan and temperature controls into one location but separating their interactions into a button press vs. a dial, the final prototype is accessible even in low-vision scenarios, such as in the dark.
                    </p>
                    <p>Highlighted fan and temperature setting displays as well as auditory and haptic feedback supplement this accessibility. You can see a demo of the prototype below.
